                <li> Mountains are large landforms that rise prominently above their surroundings, typically forming peaks.</li>
                <li>They are usually formed through tectonic forces or volcanic activity over millions of years.</li>
                <li>The Himalayas, which include Mount Everest, are the highest mountain range in the world.</li>
                <li>Mountains influence climate by affecting weather patterns and often have colder temperatures at higher altitudes. </li>
                <li>They are home to diverse ecosystems and provide habitats for many unique plant and animal species.</li>
